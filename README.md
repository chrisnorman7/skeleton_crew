## Description

Skeleton Crew allows you to create the bare bones for an audio game project using the [Ziggurat](https://pub.dev/packages/ziggurat) package. It allows you to create many common parts of the game in a GUI, then generates the code that does all the grunt work.

## Features

Currently, Skeleton Crew can generate code for the following classes:

- CommandTrigger
- Menu
